# Introduction

```{marginfigure}
R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.
```

The main goal of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions. 

```{marginfigure}
git is a version control system (like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word on steroids) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much, much better).
```

An additional goal is to introduce you to git and GitHub, which is the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course.

As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.

# Getting started

Each of your assignments will begin with the following steps. You saw these once in class yesterday, they're outlined in detail here again. Going forward each lab will start with a "Getting started" section but details will be a bit more sparse than this. You can always refer back to this lab for a detailed list of the steps involved for getting started with an assignment.

The following screencast also walks you through these steps:

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:40%"><iframe width="600" height="320" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ta_SJq3MrU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

- Click on the assignment link that you should have received in your email to create your GitHub repository (which we'll refer to as "repo" going forward) for the assignment. This repo contains a template you can build on to complete your assignment.

```{r clone-repo-link, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/clone-repo-link.png")
```

- On GitHub, click on the green **Clone or download** button, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with HTTPS** as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

```{r new-project-from-gh, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/new-project-from-gh.png")
```

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a **New Project from Git Repo**. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the **New Project** button to see this option.

```{r paste-gh-repo-url, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/paste-gh-repo-url.png")
```

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box:

- Hit OK, and you're good to go!

# Packages

In this lab we will work with three packages: `ISLR` which is a package that accomponies your textbook, `tidyverse` which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way, and `tidymodels` which is a collection of packages for modeling and statistical analyses.

Install these packages by running the following in the console.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidymodels")
install.packages("ISLR")
```

Now that the necessary packages are installed, you should be able to Knit your document and see the results.

If you'd like to run your code in the Console as well you'll also need to load the packages there. To do so, run the following in the console. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR)
```

Note that the packages are also loaded with the same commands in your R Markdown document.

# Housekeeping

```{marginfigure}
Your email address is the address tied to your GitHub account and your name should be first and last name.
```

Before we can get started we need to take care of some required housekeeping. Specifically,  we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your email address and your name.

The following screencast is a demo of what you need to do to configure your git.


<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:40%"><iframe width="600" height="320" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nD6_3C-OZyM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

To do so, follow these steps:

- Go to the *Terminal* pane
- Type the following two lines of code, replacing the information in the quotation marks with your info:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email "your email"
git config --global user.name "your name"
```

For example, for me these are

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email "mcgowald@wfu.edu"
git config --global user.name "Lucy D'Agostino McGowan"
```

To confirm that the changes have been implemented, run the following

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
```


# Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises. The following video is an overview of some of these warmup exercises.

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:40%"><iframe width="600" height="320" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XE8h8jIyu04" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

## Project name: 

Currently your project is called *Untitled Project*. Update the name of your project to be "Lab 01 - Hello R".

```{r untitled-project, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/untitled-project.png")
```

```{marginfigure}
The top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.
```

## YAML: 

Open the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and knit the document.

```{r yaml-raw-to-rendered, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/yaml-raw-to-rendered.png")
```

## Commiting changes:

Then Go to the Git pane in your RStudio.

If you have made changes to your Rmd file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on **Diff**. This shows you the *diff*erence between the last committed state of the document and its current state that includes your changes. If you're happy with these changes, write "Update author name" in the **Commit message** box and hit **Commit**.

```{r update-author-name-commit, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/update-author-name-commit.png")
```

You don't have to commit after every change, this would get quite cumbersome. You should consider committing states that are *meaningful to you* for inspection, comparison, or restoration. In the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.

## Pushing changes: 

Now that you have made an update and committed this change, it's time to push these changes to the web! Or more specifically, to your repo on GitHub. Why? So that others can see your changes. And by others, we mean the course teaching team (your repos in this course are private to you and us, only). 

In order to push your changes to GitHub, click on **Push**. This will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password. This might feel cumbersome. Bear with me... We *will* teach you how to save your password so you don't have to enter it every time. But for this one assignment you'll have to manually enter each time you push in order to gain some experience with it.

## Thought exercise:

For which of the above steps (changing project name, making updates to the document, committing, and pushing changes) do you need to have an internet connection? Discuss with your classmates.

# Data


The data frame we will be working with today is called `Auto` and it's in the `ISLR` package. 

To find out more about the dataset, type the following in your Console: `?Auto`. A question mark before the name of an object will always bring up its help file. This command must be ran in the Console. You can also use the `glimpse()` function to learn more about the dataset. Run `glimpse(Auto)` in the Console.

1. Based on the help function, how many rows and how many columns does the `Auto` file have? What are the variables included in the data frame? Add your responses to your lab report. When you're done, commit your changes with the commit message "Added answer for Ex 1", and push.

```{marginfigure}
This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.
```

# Subset

2. Create a data frame with only "Ford" cars. What is the average `mpg` for Ford cars in this data frame?

Below is the code you will need to complete this exercises. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Rmd document and successfully knit it and view the results.

Start with the `Auto` dataset and pipe it into the `filter` function to filter for observations where we detect the "ford" string in the `name` column. Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called `ford_data`.

```{r}
ford_data <- Auto %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, "ford"))
```

There is a lot going on here, so let's slow down and unpack it a bit. 

First, the pipe operator: `%>%`, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we're saying `filter` the `Auto` data frame for observations where we detect the string "ford" in the `name` column, `str_detect(name, "ford")`.

Second, the assignment operator: `<-`, assigns the name `ford_data` to the filtered data frame.

Next, we use the `summarize()` function to take the `mean()` of the `mpg` variable. We have named this new variable `avg_mpg`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ford_data %>%
  summarize(avg_mpg = mean(mpg))
```

*This is a good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message "Added answer for Ex 2", and push.*

# Data visualization

3. Return to the original `Auto` data frame. Update this data frame so that `cylinders` is a factor. Create a boxplot of `mpg` by `cylinders` for this new data frame.

Below is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Again, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Rmd document and successfully knit it and view the results.

Start with the `Auto` dataset and pipe it into the `mutate` function to create a new variable called `cylinders` that is a factor variable. Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called `Auto`.

```{r}
Auto <- Auto %>%
  mutate(cylinders = as.factor(cylinders))
```

Now let's create a visualization We will use the `ggplot` function for this. Its first argument is the data you're visualizing. Next we define the `aes`thetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the `x` axis will represent the variable called `cylinders` and the `y` axis will represent the variable called `mpg`. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which `geom`etric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be a boxplot, hence `geom_boxplot`.

```{r fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
ggplot(data = Auto, mapping = aes(x = cylinders, y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

If this seems like a lot, it is. And you will learn about the philosophy of building data visualizations in layer in detail next week. For now, follow along with the code that is provided.

*This is a good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message "Added answer for Ex 3", and push.*

4. Using the `Auto` data frame, make the `origin` variable a factor. Create a boxplot of `mpg` by `cylinders` for this new data frame. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. What do the values of `origin` stand for (hint: check `?Auto` for the data dictionary).

*This is another good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message "Added answer for Ex 4", and push.*

5. Let's fit a model. This may be a new way to fit models, again the code is going to be provided, but see if you can follow along. We are going to fit a model predicting miles per gallon from the number of cylinders and the origin of the car. 

First, let's set up how we will fit this model. We will use the `recipe()` function to dictate the model and the data. This will set the outcome and predictors.

```{r}
rec <- recipe(mpg ~ cylinders + origin, data = Auto)
summary(rec)
```

Let's prep this recipe and then fit the model.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
prep <- prep(rec)
fit(
  linear_reg,
  formula = formula(rec)
)
```


```{r}

```


You're done with the data analysis exercises, but we'd like you to do two more things:

```{r fig-resize-global, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/fig-resize-global.png")
```

- **Resize your figures:** 

Click on the gear icon in on top of the R Markdown document, and select "Output Options..." in the dropdown menu. In the pop up dialogue box go to the Figures tab and change the height and width of the figures, and hit OK when done. Then, knit your document and see how you like the new sizes. Change and knit again and again until you're happy with the figure sizes. Note that these values get saved in the YAML.

```{r fig-resize-local, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/fig-resize-local.png")
```

You can also use different figure sizes for differen figures. To do so click on the gear icon within the chunk where you want to make a change. Changing the figure sizes added new options to these chunks: `fig.width` and `fig.height`. You can change them by defining different values directly in your R Markdown document as well.

```{r theme-highlight, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/theme-highlight.png")
```

- **Change the look of your report:** 

Once again click on the gear icon in on top of the R Markdown document, and select "Output Options..." in the dropdown menu. In the General tab of the pop up dialogue box try out different Syntax highlighting and theme options. Hit OK and knit your document to see how it looks. Play around with these until you're happy with the look.

Not sure how to use emojis on your computer? Maybe a teammate can help? Or you can ask your TA as well!
  ```

*Yay, you're done! Commit all remaining changes, use the commit message "Done with Lab 1! `r emo::ji("muscle")`", and push. Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.*
