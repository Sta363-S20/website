# R and RStudio

---

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integreated development environment, IDE)
- At its simplest:<sup>➥</sup>
    - R is like a car’s engine
    - RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/engine-dashboard.png")
```

## Let's take a tour - R / RStudio

.center[
![](img/demo.png)
]

Concepts introduced:

- Console
- Using R as a calculator
- Environment
- Loading and viewing a data frame
- Accessing a variable in a data frame
- R functions

---

## R essentials

A short list (for now):

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parantheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```

--

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

---

## tidyverse

- The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data analysis and data science. 
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar.

# R Markdown

## R Markdown

- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit the analysis is run from the beginning
- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

## Let's take a tour - R Markdown


.center[
![](img/demo.png)
]

Concepts introduced:

- Copying a project of mine
- Knitting documents
- R Markdown and (some) R syntax

---

## <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> `Happy Little Clouds Example`

--

<br>

- Go to RStudio Cloud and click on `Happy Little Clouds Example`
- Open and knit the R Markdown document.

## Workspaces

Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work 
with R Markdown: The workspace of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console!

- Run the following in the console
```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```

--

.question[
All looks good, eh?
]

--

- Then, add the following chunk in your R Markdown document
```{r eval = FALSE}
x * 3
```

--

.question[
What happens? Why the error?
]

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every assignment / report / project / etc. is an R Markdown document
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
- You will turn in the .html file on Sakai

---

## Lab 01

- Lab instructions are posted on the course website under `</>`
  + Let's go find today's!
