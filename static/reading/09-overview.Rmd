_I set up an email list for folks interested in getting email reminders before class. If you did not receive an email and wish you had, please let me know._

**Note:** There are a few lectures for today that are optional if you are interested. The material will not be covered on the exam.

1. I've updated one question in [Lab 06 - Ensemble Models](https://sta-363-s20.lucymcgowan.com/labs/lab-06-ensemble.html) - for the **boosted model** please set the **learn rate to 0.1**. I have a bit of an explanation in the Midterm Review lecture. This will make sure your answers are consistent. 
2. Watch the [Midterm 03 Review](https://sta-363-s20.lucymcgowan.com/slides/21-midterm-review-lecture.html) lecture
